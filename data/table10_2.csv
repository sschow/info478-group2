AMI estimates from 2008 to 2011 may differ from previously published estimates due to revised estimation procedures. These mental illness estimates are based on a predictive model and are not direct measures of diagnostic status.",,,,,,,,,,,

"1 The measures used to estimate mental illness in 2008 partially differ from the measures used in subsequent years; however, methodological analysis indicated that the estimates are comparable. For details, see Section 3.4.7 in Chapter 3 of the 2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: Methodological Summary and Definitions.",,,,,,,,,,,
"2 Because of the use of the 2013 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes in the creation of the county type variables, these 2008 to 2014 estimates may differ from estimates published prior to the 2015 NSDUH.",,,,,,,,,,,
