* = low precision; -- = not available; da = does not apply; nc = not comparable due to methodological changes; nr = not reported due to measurement issues.,,,,,,,,,,,
NOTE: Some 2008 to 2010 estimates may differ from previously published estimates due to updates (see Section 3.3.5 in Chapter 3 of the 2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: Methodological Summary and Definitions).,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: Any Mental Illness (AMI) aligns with DSM-IV criteria and is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder. AMI estimates from 2008 to 2011 may differ from previously published estimates due to revised estimation procedures. These mental illness estimates are based on a predictive model and are not direct measures of diagnostic status.",,,,,,,,,,,
a The difference between this estimate and the 2018 estimate is statistically significant at the .05 level. Rounding may make the estimates appear identical.,,,,,,,,,,,
"1 The measures used to estimate mental illness in 2008 partially differ from the measures used in subsequent years; however, methodological analysis indicated that the estimates are comparable. For details, see Section 3.4.7 in Chapter 3 of the 2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: Methodological Summary and Definitions.",,,,,,,,,,,
