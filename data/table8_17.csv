"NOTE: Mental Health Services for adults includes inpatient treatment/counseling, outpatient treatment/counseling, or use of prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents with unknown mental health service information were excluded.",,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: Mental Illness aligns with DSM-IV criteria and is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder. Estimates of serious mental illness (SMI) are a subset of estimates of any mental illness (AMI) because SMI is limited to persons with AMI that resulted in serious functional impairment. These mental illness estimates are based on a predictive model and are not direct measures of diagnostic status.",,,,,,,,,,
a The difference between this estimate and the 2018 estimate is statistically significant at the .05 level. Rounding may make the estimates appear identical.,,,,,,,,,,
1 Respondents with no mental illness may still have received mental health services for a past disorder that is in partial or full remission or treatment for a disorder that was not included in the definition of mental illness or for other reasons.,,,,,,,,,,
"2 The Other Employment category includes students, persons keeping house or caring for children full time, retired or disabled persons, or other persons not in the labor force.",,,,,,,,,,
