"NOTE: Mental Illness aligns with DSM-IV criteria and is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder. Estimates of serious mental illness (SMI) are a subset of estimates of any mental illness (AMI) because SMI is limited to persons with AMI that resulted in serious functional impairment. These mental illness estimates are based on a predictive model and are not direct measures of diagnostic status.",,,,,,,,
a The difference between this estimate and the 2018 estimate is statistically significant at the .05 level. Rounding may make the estimates appear identical.,,,,,,,,
